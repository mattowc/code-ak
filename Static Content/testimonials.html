<h3>A Glowing Letter</h3>

I am a 40 year old law enforcement officer and triathelte. I have suffered two meniscus tears (with resulting surgeries) on my left knee. I was told I only have 50% of my meniscus left and would have to reduce the stress placed on my knee.  It  has impacted  my ability to work without pain and my athletic training.  Using the Acuknee System has allowed me to return to full athletic training, rapid recovery and pain free functioning.

<td>"I developed IT band pain while training for a half marathon. The pain lasted for months and I thought I'd have to strop training.  By using the AcuKnee™ system I was able to continue training, at minimally reduced mileage, and eliminate my pain in three weeks.  My  therapist told me to ice, use ibuprofen and take at least three weeks off. It was an incredible experience to be able to continue to train and eliminate my pain."</td>

<td>"I had chronic knee pain that forced me to stop running. Ice and Ibuprofen provided minimal relief. After two treatments with the AcuKnee™ system my pain went away completely and I was able to resume running and full, pain free activity immedietly."</td>

<td>"I suffered from 'jumper’s knee' for 5 months. I thought I was cured with the usual rest, ice, compression  NSAIDs and physical therapy, but the pain always came roaring back. I used the AcuKnee™ system every day ( pain gone in three days ) for 2 weeks  the pain was finally gone and never came back."</td>

<tr>
<td>"My IT (iliotibial band) was severe and caused excruciating pain with minimal exercise. I could not run a mile. For months, I tried every possible treatment including extensive PT, chiropractic, foam rollers, every imaginable stretch, weight loss and an anti-inflammation diet. Nothing worked. I purchased an AcuKnee™ with great skepticism and out of pure desperation. It took a month of daily treatment but I finally achieved durable pain relief. I am running and playing competitive soccer again. What a great concept."</td>

<tr>
<td>"I had suffered constant knee pain in my right knee for eleven years. My doctors told me, that due to other medical complications, there was nothing more they could do for my degenerative arthritis. I treated initially twice a day. In two days I was PAIN FREE for the first time in eleven years. The AcuKnee™ has completely changed my life."</td>

<tr>
<td>"I had patellofemoral pain (just below knee cap) and could not run. I had only had it for a few weeks but it was very distressing to me because even though I had stopped running it seemed to be getting worse. After one treatment I was durably pain free. I continued to treat and began running again. My knees feel great and I am back to full activity. It was a real plus to not have to go to physical therapy."</td>
<td>Mike, Salt Lake City</td>

<tr>
<td>"I endured two ACL tears with surgical repairs. The surgeries left me with a constant dull ache that was always worse following exercise. I bought an AcuKnee because I simply had no other options.  My knee now feels great and I am exercising more."</td>
<td>Chris, Washington</td>

<tr>
<td>"I suffered with severe osteoarthritis in my right knee that required daily ibuprofen which provided only partial pain relief. I had terrible morning pain and stiffness. I have stopped my ibuprofen and treat three times a week with the AcuKnee system.  I am completely pain free. I love my AcuKnee."</td>

<td>"I am a physician in my late fifties. I skied four full days in the spring (90,000 vetical feet). When I got home, my knees were sore and ached constantly. I ignored it for ten days and my knees were actually  getting worse. Ibuprofen provided minimal relief. I finally used my wife's AcuKnee two nights in a row and the pain was gone."</td>
