<td>"I suffered from 'jumper’s knee' for 5 months. I thought I was cured with the usual rest, ice, compression and NSAIDs but the pain always came roaring back. I used the AcuKnee™ system every day for 2 weeks and the pain was finally gone for good."</td>

<tr>
<td>"My IT (iliotibial band) was severe and caused excruciating pain with minimal exercise. I could not run a mile. For months I tried every possible treatment including extensive PT, chiropractic, foam rollers, every imaginable stretch, weight loss and anti-inflammation diet. Nothing worked. I purchased an AcuKnee™ with great skepticism and out of pure desperation. It took a month of daily treatment but I finally achieved durable pain relief. I am running and playing competitive soccer again. What a great concept."</td>

<td>"I had suffered constant knee pain in my right knee for eleven years. My doctors told me that do to other medical complications there was nothing more they could do for my degenerative arthritis. I treated initially twice a day. In two days I was PAIN FREE for the first time in eleven years. The AcuKnee™ has completely changed my life."</td>

<tr>
<td>"I had patellofemoral pain (just below knee cap) and could not run. I had only had it for a few weeks but it was very distressing to me because even though I had stopped running it seemed to be getting worse. After one treatment I was durably pain free. I continued to treat and began running again. My knees feel great and I am back to full activity. It was a real plus to not have to go to physical therapy."</td>
<td>Mike, Utah</td>

<tr>
<td>"I endured two ACL tears with surgical repairs. The surgeries left me with a fairly constant dull ache that was always worse following exercise. I bought an AcuKnee because I simply had no other options. I am happy to report my knee feels great and I am in fact exercising more."</td>
<td>Chris, Washington</td>

<tr>
<td>"I suffered with severe osteo arthritis in my right knee that required daily ibupofren which provided only partial pain relief. I had terrible morning pain and stiffness. I have stopped my ibuprofen and treat three times a week with the AcuKnee system. Very happy to report I am pain free. I love my AcuKnee."</td>

  <td>"I am a physician in my late fifties.  I skied four full days in the spring (90,000 vetical feet) When I got home, my knees were sore and ached constantly.  I ignored it for ten days and they were actually slowly getting worse. Ibuprofen provided minimal relief. I finally used my wife's AcuKnee two nights in a row and the pain went away for good."</td>
