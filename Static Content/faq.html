			How soon will I see benefits from the AcuKnee System?</a>

			<div class="accordion-inner">
				Most people see significant immediate improvement within one hour of the first treatment.  Thereafter, the effects are cumulative and you will continue to improve for the first week.  A large percentage (depending on the severity of your condition) are pain free in less than a week.  The pain relief typically lasts about 24 hours.  We urge you to continue to treat for at least an additional week after the durable resolution of your pain.  Clients with osteoarthritis are stable in about a week but will need to treat indefinetly. There is no cure for osteoarthritis,  but the AcuKnee will eliminate or greatly reduce the need for pain medications and may slow the progression of the disease.

<div class="accordion-heading"><a class="accordion-toggle" href="#collapseTwo" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion2">Why does this work for osteoarthritis?</a></div>
<div id="collapseTwo" class="accordion-body collapse">
<div class="accordion-inner">Osteoarthritis, at its earliest stage and before you have even minimal pain, is characterized by inflammation.  This inflammation is chronic and ongoing.  The AcuKnee system, in addition to minimizing pain, reduces inflammation in the joint.  By reducing inflammation, you reduce pain and may reduce the risk of continung joint damage.</div>

<div class="accordion-group">
<div class="accordion-heading"><a class="accordion-toggle" href="#collapseThree" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion2">Why do I need to change the polarity when I switch to the opposite knee?</a></div>
<div id="collapseThree" class="accordion-body collapse">
<div class="accordion-inner">The AcuKnee is a meridian based precision electrotherapy system.  Accordingly, the direction of current flow is very important.  You will benefit from the treatment without changing the polarity but  we have found greater efficacy with strict attention to polarity.</div>

<div class="accordion-heading"><a class="accordion-toggle" href="#collapseFour" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion2">I suffered a sports related overuse injury. Do I need to stop exercising while treating with AcuKnee?</a></div>
<div id="collapseFour" class="accordion-body collapse">
<div class="accordion-inner">Probably not.  Some prefer to rest and treat with the AcuKnee for several days.  Most people can resume LIGHT exercise in a gradual fashion as your symptoms improve.  DO NOT ICE the knee at any time if you are using the AcuKnee system.</div>
</div>

<div class="accordion-group">
<div class="accordion-heading"><a class="accordion-toggle" href="#collapseFive" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion2">I have a torn meniscus.  Can I treat with with the AcuKnee?</a></div>
<div id="collapseFive" class="accordion-body collapse">
<div class="accordion-inner">No. We do not recommend it.  The ongoing irritation of the meniscus or meniscal fragment within the joint greatly dimishes the effect and there will be no lasting resolution. In addition, there is a risk of the treatment itself further irritating the knee.</div>
</div>

<div class="accordion-group">
<div class="accordion-heading"><a class="accordion-toggle" href="#collapseSix" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion2">Why is it important to NOT ice while using the AcuKnee?</a></div>
<div id="collapseSix" class="accordion-body collapse">
<div class="accordion-inner">Ice is a great anti-inflammatory for acute injury. However, it has became clear to us that icing (especially before or after a teatment) diminishes or abolishes the positive effects of the AcuKnee treatment.</div>

<div class="accordion-group">
<div class="accordion-heading"><a class="accordion-toggle" href="#collapseSeven" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion2">What is the COM program?</a></div>
<div id="collapseSeven" class="accordion-body collapse">
<div class="accordion-inner">The COM program is a combined frequency program designed to deliver a precise set of sequenced frequencies over a  specified period of a time. It is designed for the AcuKnee treatment. It combines ultra high and low frequencies.  It takes thirty minutes and should, in general, be used only once a day.</div>

<div class="accordion-group">
<div class="accordion-heading"><a class="accordion-toggle" href="#collapseEight" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion2">What is the HAN program?</a></div>
<div id="collapseEight" class="accordion-body collapse">
<div class="accordion-inner">The HAN program delivers short alternating bursts of staggered frequencies. It is designed as a "rescue"  program should the COM program provide inadequate relief or if the COM program stops providing adequate relief.  When combined with program 13 ( our gentlest  neuromuscular stimulation program )  it is the standard program for the AcuBac. The AcuBac treats for 15 min on program 13 , followed by 30 min with the HAN program.</div>

<div class="accordion-heading"><a class="accordion-toggle" href="#collapseNine" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion2">What makes the AcuKnee different from other electrotherapy treatments?  Why do you only treat for thirty minutes daily?</a></div>
<div id="collapseNine" class="accordion-body collapse">
<div class="accordion-inner">Most other electrotherapy systems operate on the principle that more is better.  We fundamentally disagree with this approach. We recommend  you treat once a day for thirty minutes.  We recommend you do not ice.  Treating more often dimminishes the effect over time, creates the risk of the body developing tolerence to the treatment and can immedietely blunt the body's  release of pain relieving compounds.  We are developing a nightime treatment (AcuKnee Nightfall ) that delivers very small amounts of energy over a long period of time ( 8 hours) but the total applied 'dose'  is extraordinarily low.  In addition, for the convience of the customer, AcuKnee is available without a prescription.</div>

<div class="accordion-heading"><a class="accordion-toggle" href="#collapseTen" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion2">I am extremely tall. Do I need change the the position of the electrodes?</a></div>
<div id="collapseTen" class="accordion-body collapse">
<div class="accordion-inner">Yes. Slightly. The AcuKnee is designed to fit the average person from 5'6" to 6'2". The Velcro reciever patches are in the standard position. If you are very tall or very short you should move each pad vertically (.25 to .5 inch) away (if tall) and toward (if short) the knee cap hole.  If you have a very large diameter leg you should move the electrodes slighlty laterally (.25 to .5 inch). Please see our soon to be posted  video on fitting and using the AcuKnee.</div>

<div class="accordion-heading"><a class="accordion-toggle" href="#collapseEleven" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion2">I am very over weight. BMI over 50. Can I use the AcuKnee?</a></div>
<div id="collapseEleven" class="accordion-body collapse">
<div class="accordion-inner">We do not reccomend the AcuKnee for clients with a BMI over 40 (with the exception of athletes with high muscle mass).  You should know how to determine you BMI (body mass index).  Google BMI, find a formula and enter your height and weight.  If your BMI is over 40 you may experience decreased effectiveness.  The wrap will fit an extraordinary range of individuals--up to a thigh circumference of 28 to 30 inches.  We have had patients up to a BMI of 57 have suprisingly good results.  We are happy to make a CUSTOM WRAP for you up to 38 inches.  It is not returnable and may take up to 10 days. The wrap itself is $129 and does not come with the AcuKnee graphics, lead wires, electrodes or instructional placard screened on the top inside. In addition, the wrap is made of a thicker, heavy duty  neoprene.  If interested, please contact us at info@AcuKnee.com.</div>

<div class="accordion-heading"><a class="accordion-toggle" href="#collapseTwelve" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion2">How often do I need to change the electrodes?</a></div>
<div id="collapseTwelve" class="accordion-body collapse">
<div class="accordion-inner">With daily use and meticulous care you should change them once a month. Careful attention to replacing the plastic electrode covers in the correct orientation--this side up-- as written on the plastic will further extend the electrode life.  In addition to a small amount of gel you should periodically  brush the electrodes gently with a used tooth brush dipped in warm water.  This allows the removal of accumulatd gel and dead skin cells that stick to th electrodes.  With older electrodes you may notice it takes larger amounts of current to feel the same stimulation effect.  As electrodes age,  the resistance increases.  Above all, when you remove the wrap or an electrode, pull very GENTLY as your peel off the wrap. This prevents delamination of the electrode.  If you fail to replace the electrode covers  ( with the correct side orientation ) after use they will dry out quickly and may not work well. When in doubt, change them.</div>

<div id="collapseThirteen" class="accordion-body collapse">
<div class="accordion-inner">If you were half way or more through the program go to PRG 03 and treat for 15 minutes. If you are less than halfway into the program, simply start over with the COM program and allow it to run for the full 30 minutes.</div>

<div id="collapseFourteen" class="accordion-body collapse">
<div class="accordion-inner">People using narcotics (as well as people who drink excessively) may have a diminished response.  Customers who respond favorably to the AcuKnee treatment may find that they can reduce or stop their pain medications.  YOU SHOULD NEVER CHANGE YOUR DOSE OR STOP YOUR NARCOTIC MEDICATIONS WITHOUT CONSULTING YOUR PHYSICIAN.  Almost all our customers stop or dramatically reduce their use of ibuprofen, naproxen or celecoxib because of the pain reduction they experience using the AcuKnee.</div>

<div id="collapseFifteen" class="accordion-body collapse">
<div class="accordion-inner">Once returned, we can not resell the system. The electrotherapy unit itself may become part of a trial or demonstration unit.  We cannot reuse the wrap.  Many manufacturers of medical equipment do not allow returns of any kind. We are implementing a 21 day trial program for a flat, one time fee of $99 and we pay the return shipping costs.</div>

<div class="accordion-inner">AcuKnee, LLC  is committed to developing a line of highly effective, FDA cleared, electrotherapy based  treatments for acute and chronic pain.  The AcuKnee has proven itself to be extraordinarily effective.  While we have other programs under development, we will not release and market a pain management program until we are confident it will provide the  same extraordinary degree of effectiveness that the AcuKnee has shown.</div>

<div id="collapseSeventeen" class="accordion-body collapse">
<div class="accordion-inner">The PainWarrior® electrotherapy unit consists of only 14 programs.  A 510K has been filed and cleared by the FDA  to allow the  sale of the PainWarrior without a prescription.  This is made possible by extensive testing and the sophisticated safety features built into the PainWarrior®.  These features include the automatic shut off if loss of skin contact is sensed, and a lock out feature which prevents accidental or unintended increases in the electrotherapy output.  The AcuKnee is a dedicated positioning device that minimizes any undesirable side effects. The AcuKnee has also been approved by Medicare for prescription (if all requirements are met) and non-prescription use, as well as HSA and FLEX health benefit plans.</div>
