<h3>PainWarrior® with AcuKnee™</h3>
Before every use match the polarity shown in the images above for your knee. The AcuKnee™ is pre-set for the right knee. To treat the left knee reverse the polarity. To confirm the correct polarity, the outside top electrode (outside thigh) should have a black connector (Channel A) and the inside top (inside thigh) should have the red connector (Channel B).
<h3>AcuKnee Tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Drop of gel each pad before use (last longer and better connectivity)</li>
  <li>Replace protective sheet on pad after each use</li>
  <li>Wrap snug – not tight</li>
  <li>Turn on – if not on COM mode, select program until it cycles through to COM</li>
  <li>Turn up + button on each side – should be equal and NOT painful (want to be aware of sensation, but not in pain).</li>
  <li>After 1 minute on a setting, it has safety lock.  If you want to increase level, you will need to select the (-)  button first before increasing (+)</li>
  <li>At 15 minutes it will automatically change to other frequency.  You may need to adjust +/- settings to equal, aware, not painful</li>
  <li>When done treating take off gently (don’t pull hard on pads – they will last longer)</li>
  <li>Treat only once per day (more is not better)</li>
  <li>Do not use ice on the treatment knee (it decreases effectiveness of treatment)</li>
</uL>
<p>
  It has a cumulative effect.  It will get better, last longer with each treatment.
